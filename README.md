# My Final Project for "Developing Back-End Apps with Node.js and Express" course

This is an Node.js app that covers implementation of CRUD capabilities as HTTP methods, as well as session and JWT authentication to restrict user access to perform certain operations.

I am glad to share that I [passed](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/RIGDL1DLJ21R) my course and learned a lot on it :)
